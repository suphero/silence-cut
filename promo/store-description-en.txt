Silence Cut – Automatically skip or speed through silent and music-only sections in YouTube videos. Save time and stay focused on what matters.

⚡ WHY SILENCE CUT?

Have you ever watched a tutorial, podcast, or lecture on YouTube and noticed long pauses, awkward silences, or background music segments that add nothing to the content? Those dead moments add up — sometimes eating 10-20% of a video's total length.

Silence Cut detects these moments in real time and automatically handles them for you. No more manually scrubbing forward. No more wasted time.

🎯 KEY FEATURES

✅ Automatic Silence Detection
Silence Cut continuously analyzes the audio stream of any YouTube video. When the volume drops below your configured threshold for a set duration, the extension instantly takes action — either skipping ahead or speeding up playback.

✅ Two Action Modes
• Skip Mode: Jumps past silent sections entirely, getting you straight to the next spoken word.
• Speed Mode: Accelerates playback during silence (up to 16x speed), so you maintain context while saving time.

✅ Music Detection (Optional)
Enable music detection to also handle segments where only background music is playing with no speech. Great for podcasts and tutorials that use intro/outro music or transition jingles.

✅ Fully Customizable
Fine-tune every parameter to match your preferences:
• Silence Threshold: Set the volume level (in dB) that counts as "silent" — from -60 dB (very sensitive) to -10 dB (only catches total silence).
• Minimum Duration: Define how long a quiet moment must last before the extension acts — from 0.1 seconds to 3 seconds.
• Speed Multiplier: Choose how fast to play through silent sections — from 2x to 16x.
• Music Sensitivity: Adjust how aggressively music segments are detected — from low to high.

✅ Live Monitoring Dashboard
The popup shows you exactly what's happening in real time:
• Current volume level with a visual meter
• Active silence and music detection indicators
• Skip counter — see how many silent sections have been handled
• Time saved — track exactly how much time you've saved in the current session

✅ Lightweight & Privacy-Friendly
• No data collection — everything runs locally in your browser
• No external servers — audio analysis happens entirely on your device
• Minimal permissions — only requires access to YouTube and local storage for your settings
• No background resource usage — the extension only activates on YouTube tabs

💡 TIPS

• Start with default settings and adjust gradually if needed.
• If too many sections are being skipped, increase the minimum duration or raise the threshold (closer to -10 dB).
• Use Speed mode instead of Skip mode if you want to maintain continuity while still saving time.
• Enable music detection for podcast-style videos with long musical intros.
